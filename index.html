                    <p>Hello, my name is Akanksha Kapoor.I am a native of the capital of India, New Delhi.
                        I have done my Graduation from GGSIPU College, New Delhi.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    When I was in the Engineering College, I had made up my mind to become a Software Developer.
                    I love to be a software developer. I am doing Full Stack Developer Certification from UT Austin.
                    I was a software Developer with 3 years of experience in the software developing field.
                    </p>
                    <p>With my experience I have learned
                        <ul>
                            <li>Java</li>
                            <li>HTML</li>
                            <li>Bootstrap</li>
                            <li>PL/SQL</li>
                            <li>Javascript</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p> I have been associated with TCS as a Subject Matter Expert for UK business enhancements.
                        I enjoy being a Lead and the opportunity to empower and motivate my team. 
                        Although I loved my role, I feel I am now ready for a more challenging assignment. 
                        My goal is to build a successful career as a Software Developer, which can help my company and me personally.
                        My strengths are my positive attitude, punctuality, interpersonal skills and strong in management skills. 
                        My weakness is my emotional nature which lands me in trouble sometimes.
                         I am a good team player and goal oriented. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, that was just a brief summary of my journey so far.
                        However, if u would like to know any further details I would be glad to share it.
